Dates should have a specific detector, learner and transformer
Winsor : When x < Xmin, don't replace with x but rather with (x - epsilon),
    in order to keep as much data as possible (here, that it was extreme)
apply_transformer : when a column ends up with zero variance, send a warning,
    because that may be the result of the test set being different than the
    train one, thus creating empty ohe columns
Handle NAs directly during learning (optionnal). The simplest solution would be
    define which columns have NAs (and create _NAs columns) and then impute
    everything (including those which are not supposed to have NAs) with values
    corresponding to their type. Make sure to update factor levels if so.
Learn should be able to deal with tables without any target column
Learn should be able to learn categorical embeddings that take the target col
    into account (like average target for this value)
Learn should be able to learn low dimensional embeddings (deep features, ...)

# drift
Option : add an "ID" column to compare the RMSE and Kappa to the worst case ?
What is an acceptable level of drift in RMSE ?
What is an acceptable level of drift in Kappa ?

# tests
Tests should not use files in my personal computer, so I should understand how testthat works to use a tempfile or a package file.

# package setup
Write the vignette : http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/vignettes.html#vignettes
Explicitely import functions using ::, or (worse) use NAMESPACES
Check external data part http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/data.html#data
Consider using Travis : http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/check.html#check

# CRAN release
Maybe one day. Check here : http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/release.html#release
